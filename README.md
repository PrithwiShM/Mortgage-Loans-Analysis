## Loss Severity Modeling of Single-Family Residential Mortgage Loans

This project incorporates a deep investigation of the mortgage loan data extracted from Mannie Mae. The final goal of this project is to predict the loss given default from different predictors including macroeconomic parameters. The project can be mainly divided into two segments sequentially. The first one is feature engineering using exploratory data analysis and cleaning of the data. Feature engineering included general intuition and using effective data parameters to engineer fruitful predictors. The next part of the project includes improving accuracy. We did this via the subset selection method to improve the data logistics of the model by selecting a smaller set of predictors to give the same accuracy. The next part was using higher-order statistical models.

Mortgage loan data analysis is very relevant because mortgage loans are one of the biggest selling credit products and deeply influence the financial industry. Also, analyzing mortgage loans gives a good insight into credit risk modeling as well because many of the credit derivatives that lenders issue are similar to mortgage loans.
